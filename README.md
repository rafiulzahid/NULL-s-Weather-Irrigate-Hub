This project focuses on the development of a smart
irrigation system designed to optimize water usage for
agricultural lands. The system employs soil moisture sensors
to monitor the soil's moisture levels and determine the
necessity of irrigation, ensuring efficient water use.
Complementing this, a weather monitoring subsystem is
integrated, utilizing rain detector sensors and DHT sensors to
measure rainfall, humidity, and other relevant environmental
conditions
